CODE OF CONDUCT FOR SEM-G20 MEMBERS

**Introduction**

As a group for Software Engineering Methods it is necessary to set a clear set of rules to direct the behaviour of its members to ensure team members act in a professional manner at all times.

Members are expected to exercise their own judgement to ensure that they meet the requirements outlined, and they should ask for advice if ever in doubt.

The goal of SEM-G20 is to complete the Software Engineering Methods Coursework to the highest possible standard, within the time scale set out by the module delivery team.

**Breaches to code of conduct**

If any member of SEM-G20 knows of, or becomes aware of a breach of the code of conduct by another member, they are under obligation to notify the rest of the group immediately.

Any breach of the code of conduct brought to the attention of SEM-G20 will be considered under the group's disciplinary procedures.

**SEM-G20 Code of Conduct**

This code of conduct:

- Sets out standards required by SEM-G20 as a condition of being a member of the group.
- Sets out examples of breaches of the code of conduct, providing examples to help members understand their responsibilities better.
- Applies to all members of SEM-G20, regardless of the role they fulfil.
- Details possible repercussions of members who breach the code of conduct.

**Professional Competence and Integrity**

You shall:

1. Not claim any level of competence or skills that you don't have.
2. Respect and value alternative viewpoints as well as taking on honest criticism and making suitable changes.

**Duty to the group**

You shall:

1. Uphold the reputation and ensure a good standing of SEM-G20.
2. Act with integrity and respect to fellow team members of SEM-G20 and with members of other teams.

Members must not:

1. Arrive late or miss Code Reviews without previously informing other members of the team, including a reason for absence or why they are unable to attend.
2. Bully or harass any other team members in any form, including via social media, text messages, email or in person.
3. Use their mobile phones or laptops during team meetings for purposes not related to the meeting.

**Enforcement**

Breaches of the code of conduct may be reported to the rest of the group. All complaints will be reviewed with relevant evidence at the next available meeting with a member of the module delivery team.

The individual with evidence against them will have the opportunity to prove mitigating circumstances either to the student team or privately to a member of the module delivery team.

The module delivery team has the right to the final decision of whether the dismissal is warranted.

Any dismissed team member has a week to appeal the decision to the module team with suitable evidence provided.
